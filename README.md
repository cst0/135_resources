# 135_resources

This repository contains some example code for folks doing ML work. It will be updated as the semester continues.

Recommended usage:

1. Clone this repository: `git@github.com:cst0/135_resources.git`
2. Find the example you want and run it in Python (e.g., `python pandas_operations/basics.py`)

Each example will provide a bunch of text output describing what it does. Alternatively, you can read through each one
manually.

Directory breakdown:

### Pandas Operations
| File         | Description     |
|--------------|-----------|
| basics.py | basic pandas frame creation and manipulation. |
| advanced.py | dealing with NaNs, complex time series, and using the `appy` and `rolling` functions. |
