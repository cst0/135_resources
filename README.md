# 135_resources

This repository contains some example code for folks doing ML work. It will be updated as the semester continues.

Recommended usage:

1. Clone this repository: `git@github.com:cst0/135_resources.git`
2. Find the example you want and run it in Python (e.g., `python pandas_operations/basics.py`)

Each example will provide a bunch of text output describing what it does. Alternatively, you can read through each one
manually.

There's also a 'challenges.py' which will be in each directory. Feel free to complete these if you'd like a bit of
practice with using the concepts introduced by the examples.

Directory breakdown:

### Numpy Operations
